                            <p>You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. CarDesta automatically collects Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection with your use of the Site (e.g., the type of car you are looking for). CarDesta collects personally identifiable information only when you make it available through your use of the Site. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain services on this Site, including, but not limited to, the "Email the Dealer/Seller" feature and to purchase and create a "Sell It Yourself" online classified listing ("SIY Ad") and account ("SIY Account"). In addition, you may submit personally identifiable information through the Site in other ways, including: (a) participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes; (b) subscribing to newsletters, editorial content, or promotional content sent via email, (c) using the Site's "Feedback" and "More Information" forms; and (d) in connection with other products, services, features, or requests made available through the Site. We also publish toll-free phone numbers for many of the dealerships that list vehicles for sale on the Site. If you dial one of these phone numbers, CarDesta or a service provider operating on CarDesta's behalf may record the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with other information that may be captured. Any Usage Data (as defined in the next section) and/or personally identifiable information resulting from such calls may be used as described in this Statement. The types of personally identifiable information that you provide will depend on the nature of the submission, but could include your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. In the event that you purchase a SIY Ad in a print/online package through a newspaper Affiliate, the Affiliate is required to share your name, phone number and email address with CarDesta in order to allow CarDesta to process and maintain your ad.</p>

CarDesta may collect geo-location information (this may include when you use location-based products and services on the Site, and/or turn on location-based services on your mobile device). This information may reveal your actual location, such as GPS data, or it may not, such as when you submit a partial address to look at a map of the area.

                                CarDesta shares the personally identifiable information that you provide with third parties in the following cases:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1. Affiliates. CarDesta may share your personally identifiable information with Affiliates on the condition that the Affiliates' disclosure and use of the information is consistent with this Statement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. Requests. If you request information or services through the Site, you agree that CarDesta may share personally identifiable information with third parties as may be necessary to provide such information to or perform such services for you. For example, if you use the Site's "Email the Dealer" form in a vehicle listing to request a price quote from a dealership, CarDesta will share the information you entered with that dealership (or its designee). If that vehicle listing was provided by an automobile manufacturer on behalf of a dealer, CarDesta may also share the personally identifiable information you submit as part of the request with the automobile manufacturer and/or its affiliates. Similarly, if through the Site you request additional information from a financial institution, CarDesta will share your information with that institution. Personally identifiable information also may be included in reports to these third parties, but only when you have intended to submit the information to the third party as described above. After the information is provided to such third parties, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices and CarDesta does not control their subsequent use or disclosure of information.
                            </p>

                                3. Sweepstakes/Promotions. In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion on the Site that is sponsored by CarDesta and a third party, CarDesta reserves the right to share personally identifiable information collected in conjunction with the sweepstakes, contest or promotion with the third party. After the information is provided to such third parties, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                4. Direct Marketing. Except as provided herein, it is CarDesta's policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of our customers to third parties specifically for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. If you are 18 years of age or older and have affirmatively agreed to receive third-party direct marketing materials, CarDesta may share personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Although CarDesta will notify all third-party direct marketers that the information provided to them is confidential, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                5. Service Providers. CarDesta may work with third parties that provide services on its behalf, including, among others, providers of analytical, attribution, development, promotional, research, credit card processing, technical and other services. For example, CarDesta may ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send newsletters on its behalf. Similarly, if you make a payment to CarDesta by credit card, CarDesta may share your personally identifiable information and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the credit card processing service provider on CarDesta's behalf. In such cases, CarDesta asks that the third party maintain your personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by CarDesta.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                6. Email List Opt-Outs. In the event CarDesta sends promotional emails to you on behalf of third-party advertisers and you inform CarDesta you wish to opt out of future promotional emails from a particular third party, CarDesta may share your email address with that third party so the third party may add you to its opt-out lists.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                7. Other. CarDesta expressly reserves the right to release any personally identifiable information or other information you provide to third parties under the following circumstances: (a) when required by law or legal process, (b) to investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Site, (c) to protect the property or safety of our users or others, (d) to enforce our Terms of Service and (e) in connection with any sale or other transfer of ownership of all or a part of CarDesta. Further, if you make any personally identifiable information publicly available on the Site, CarDesta reserves the right to disclose such information to third parties, including, without limitation, insurance companies and CarDesta's Affiliates and third-party distribution partners.

                                Please note that the messages that CarDesta sends to you to confirm, fulfill or follow up on a request may incidentally include promotional material or other content from CarDesta or its partners. CarDesta reserves the right to share Usage Data with any third party for any reason.
